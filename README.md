# Quantum-Modularization
Gate-based and annealing based hybrid algorithms for community detection in networks. 
The provided code represents an implementation of existent hybrid quantum classical algorithms as well as novel ones for gate-model devices. 
The folders are organized according to the algorithms names with all methods to run them included. The packages for the Louvain algorithm are not included in this repository but referenced in the text file. Utilizing actual quantum devices requires registration at IBM or D-Wave to get access.
This repository represents the underlying work regarding the article XXX for the purpose of result reproducibility and usage in the quantum community. The raw data that has been obtained throughout the evaluation is stated in "results.xlsx".

The following souces have been used for the conducted experiments:
Louvain algorithm: https://github.com/taynaud/python-louvain
QA2: an adapted version to the one found in https://github.com/hannureittu/Communitypanning has been implemented
QLS: adapted version (different for GB1 and GB2) to the one found in  http://bit.ly/QLSCommunity has been used for Quantum Local Search.
